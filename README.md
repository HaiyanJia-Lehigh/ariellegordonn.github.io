Hello, welcome to my page! My name is Arielle Gordon, and I am currently a senior at Lehigh majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in Marketing and Mass Communications. This semester I am interning for Briogeo haircare, and hope to continue my career in the wellness field after graduation. In my spare time I enjoy doing crafts and being outdoors.
